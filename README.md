To create a gif you just need to run cube_wave/cube_wave.pde which outputs all frames as png files.
Those need to be converted to single gif files with thecube_wave/output/convert.bat.
After that all the gif files can be stitched together to one file with cube_wave/output/gif.bat.

The bat files are very simple and can easily be replicated with bash if you need to.
